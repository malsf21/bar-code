## Code that makes mad bars

Bar-Code is a small Javascript web app that generates rhymes for the user, with a few options to tweak to make the bars go hard in the paint. While this was designed with rap/hip-hop music in mind, it's usable for poetry, writing, singing, and any other use you can imagine!

I made the original code in an hour, so expect it to bug out sometimes. If you've got any feedback, I'd love to see an Issue or PR.
